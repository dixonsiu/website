### October 14th ~ 15th, 2PM ~ 5PM

<span style="Color: Red">Still available for [Pre-Registration](https://www.didalliancekorea2020.com/)!</span>

I'm honoured be one of the presenters. Even though I am not a Decentralized Identity (DID) expert, I hope that these cross pollinate actions between DID and personal data store (PDS) will spark fruitful collaborations in the near future.
