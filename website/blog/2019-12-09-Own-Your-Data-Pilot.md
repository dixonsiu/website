Personium and [OwnYourData](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/) are proud to announce their partnership in this initiative and look forward to collaborate actively. We expect to showcase results in the upcoming MyData 2020 events.  

As of December 2019, Personium Team had started implementing the endpoint (Personium app) for Tally Zoo [Documentation](http://bit.ly/TallyZoo_with_CEPS ).

During MyData 2019 conference (September 2019) in Helsinki, several PDS innovators had come together and discussed openly regarding the interoperability between different PDSs. After the conference, Christoph Fabianek (OwnYourData) and Salman Farmanfarmaian ([Freezr](http://www.freezr.info/)) contributed the first draft of the implementation document.

The goal of the initiative is to allow users of different PDSs (right now: Freezr, Personium, [Datafund](https://datafund.io/), [Data Vault](https://data-vault.eu/en/new)) to use the same app and switch between data stores. In a first step a simple app (Tally Zoo: maintain a tally chart for frequent tasks and collect your everyday data) was implemented that can connect natively to the individual PDSs. Subsequently, common interfaces for authorization and common operations like read/write should be harmonized across participating organizations to decouple data store development and app development.
