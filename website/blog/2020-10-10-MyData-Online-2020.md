Besides the hardcore technical session (Personal Data Store Inter-Operability) that MyData Operators discuss what should be done about PDS interoperability, Personium is also organizing two other sessions that touch on the sensitive topics of trust, wellbeing, and data privacy.  

- Fujitsu's global personal data strategy (Inspired by the [Fujitsu Technology and Service Vision](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/vision/))  
- MyData Movement in Digital Global South (Lead by [MyData Asia Hub](https://mydataasia.org/))
