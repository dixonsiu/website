On July 29th, Personium was honoured to receive the MyData Operator 2020 Award. The award was given to 16 world-leading organisations from 12 countries, all working for humans-centric approaches to personal data.  

The MyData Operator 2020 Award was created by the internationally recognised nonprofit MyData Global. The award acknowledges organisations that place the individual at the centre of personal data about them, provide tools to help them manage personal data, and have the individual as the primary beneficiary of this data.
