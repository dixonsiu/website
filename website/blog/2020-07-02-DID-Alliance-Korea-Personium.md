I'm honoured to give a forty (40) minutes presentation on Personium overview and why PDS (personal data store) needs DID (decentralized identifier). Around thirty (30) audiences from fourteen (14) organizations had attended and we had some fruitful discussions.

Important takeaway is how to empower the citizen using DID and PDS to produce added value services.
