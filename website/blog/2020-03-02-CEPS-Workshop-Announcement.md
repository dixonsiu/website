Personium is going to host a PDS interoperability workshop with [OwnYourData](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/) and [Freezr](http://www.freezr.info/) at the Spring Community Meeting of MyData Global in Amsterdam.

A Common Endpoint for Personal data Stores ([CEPS](https://mydata-global.org/common-endpoints)) allows sharing apps and exchanging data. With CEPS, applications can be written once and be used with any CEPS-compliant personal data store. In this community meeting we will present the current status of this new initiative and invite others to join for creating a truly open and transparent group in fostering data exchange between Personal Data Stores.
