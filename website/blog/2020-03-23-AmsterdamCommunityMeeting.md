## Make it happen, make it right!!!  
MyData [Spring Community Meeting Online](https://mydata.org/online-community-meeting-19-20-march/) was a great success. Around 90 people on the first day and over 50 peoople on the second day participate in workshops, webinars and open space sessions. Our discussions varied from regular interoperability issues/ideas to sharing facts/agruements/proposals on COVID-19.  

We will share details in a few days. Here are summaries provided by [Sille Sepp](https://twitter.com/SeppSille) (MyData Global Community Lead).
