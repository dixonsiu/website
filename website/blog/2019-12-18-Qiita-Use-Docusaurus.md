We are preparing renewal of Personium documentation pages using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator for Open Source documentation websites. With this renewal, they will get more easy-to-read, easy-to-navigate, easy-to-maintain and above all, beautiful! An article on the making of the documentation was published on Qiita.
