## Introduction

Before you begin, read [Personium Architecture](../user_guide/001_Personium_Architecture.md).

Figure

Whole steps are:

1. [Setup Personium](./unit-setup.md)
2. [Create Cell](../unit-administrator/tutorial.md)
3. [Develop App using Personium](./appdev.md)

If you want to use main Personium's APIs now, you can request a demo cell that we already set up.
To request, please join our [Slack community](https://bit.ly/Join_Personium_Slack) and give a message to the #demo-cell-request channel.

By this way, you could skip 1 and 2 steps. And you can touch demo apps and start step 3 soon.
