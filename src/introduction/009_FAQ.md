1. **The Ansible seems to have finished successfully and the Personium Unit has been built. Next, I would like to create a Cell, but how do I do that?**  
Let's try the Cell creation API, which is a Unit-level API, by referring to the [Cell creation tutorial](../unit-administrator/tutorial#sect5.1).  

1. **What to do if I get an error message (PR401-AU-0008) when I try to perform operations (Cell operations or searching queries) on the Personium Unit using the [UUT](../unit-administrator/Unit-User#unit-user-token-unit-user-token-uut) (Unit User Token)?**  
Please make sure that the common name (FQDN) of the Unit certificate that you set up when you built your Personium Unit matches the FQDN of the Personium Unit you are currently accessing.  
Perform the following procedures on the AP server ([all-in-one](https://github.com/personium/ansible/tree/develop/all-in-one) / [3-tier](https://github.com/personium/ansible/tree/develop/3-tier)) to verify the common name of the Unit certificate and create a new Unit certificate with the correct common name if needed.  
    1. Execute the commands in the [Unit Certificate](../server-operator/Confirm_environment_settings#unit-certificate) section to get common name of the current Unit certificate.  

    1. Recreate the Unit certificate with the correct common name.  
        > Refer to [How to generate Self-signed Unit Certificate](https://github.com/personium/ansible/blob/master/How_to_generate_Self-signed_Unit_Certificate.md)  
        > OR  
        > [How to set coordination between units](../server-operator/unit_coordination/)  

    1. Replace the following files in the folder (e.g. "/opt/x509") that contains the Unit certificate.  
        - unit.key  
        - unit-self-sign.crt  

    1. Restart Tomcat  
    ```# systemctl restart tomcat```
